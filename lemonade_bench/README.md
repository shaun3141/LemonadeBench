# 🍋 LemonadeBench

A Lemonade Stand Tycoon simulation environment built on [OpenEnv](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/OpenEnv) for reinforcement learning research.

## Overview

LemonadeBench simulates a classic lemonade stand business where an RL agent must learn to:

- **Set optimal prices** based on weather conditions
- **Manage inventory** efficiently (lemons, sugar, cups)
- **Build reputation** through customer satisfaction
- **Maximize profit** over a 14-day summer season

## Quick Start

```python
from lemonade_bench import LemonadeEnv, LemonadeAction

# Connect to a running server
client = LemonadeEnv(base_url="http://localhost:8000")

# Reset and play
result = client.reset()
print(f"Day {result.observation.day}: {result.observation.weather}")

action = LemonadeAction(price_per_cup=75, cups_to_make=30)
result = client.step(action)
print(f"Sold {result.observation.cups_sold} cups!")
```
